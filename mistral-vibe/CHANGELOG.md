## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- /resume command to choose which session to resume
- Web search and web fetch tools for retrieving and searching web content
- MCP sampling support: MCP servers can request LLM completions via the sampling protocol
- MCP server discovery cache (`MCPRegistry`): survives agent switches without re-discovering unchanged servers
- Chat mode for ACP (`session/set_config_options` with `mode=chat`)
- ACP `session/set_config_options` support for switching mode and model
- Tool call streaming: tool call arguments are now streamed incrementally in the UI
- Notification indicator in CLI: terminal bell and window title change on action required or completion
- Subagent traces saved in `agents/` subfolder of parent session directory
- IDE detection in `new_session` telemetry
- Discover agents, tools, and skills in subfolders of trusted directories (monorepo support)
- E2E test infrastructure for CLI TUI

### Changed

- System prompts rewritten for improved model behavior (3-phase Orient/Plan/Execute workflow, brevity rules)
- Tool call display refactored with `ToolCallDisplay`/`ToolResultDisplay` models and per-tool UI customization
- Middleware pipeline replaces observer pattern for system message injections
- Improved permission handling for `write_file`, `read_file`, `search_replace` (allowlist/denylist globs, out-of-cwd detection)
- Proxy setup UI updated with guided bottom-panel wizard
- Smoother color transitions in CLI loader animation
- Dead tool state classes removed (`Grep`, `ReadFile`, `WriteFile` state)

### Fixed

- Agent switch (Shift+Tab) no longer freezes the UI (moved to thread worker)
- Empty assistant messages are no longer displayed
- Tool results returned to LLM in correct order matching tool calls
- Auto-scroll suspended when user has scrolled up; resumes at bottom
- Retry and timeout handling in Mistral backend (backoff strategy, configurable timeout)

### Removed

### Fixed

### Fixed
